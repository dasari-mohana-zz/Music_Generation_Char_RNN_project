# Music_Generation_Char_RNN_project


## Music Format (Input)

Generally, Music is represented in 4 types:

1. Sheet Music (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music)

2. abc - notation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_notation)

3. MIDI (https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-generate-music-using-a-lstm-neural-network-in-keras-68786834d4c5)

4. mp3 format (sound)

#### In this project, I am using abc-notion of Music as it is easy to train a RNN model on top of character sequences

## Requirements

This code is written in Python, and it requires the [Keras] deep learning library.

In this project, I will use the Keras library to create and train the LSTM model. Once the model is trained we will use it to generate the musical notation for our music.

## Data Source

All input data is placed in the `data/` directory. The file `input.txt` is taken from the [Nottingham Dataset (Cleaned)](https://github.com/jukedeck/nottingham-dataset) with total 340 tunes.

## Files

train.py --> Creating Batches of data

model.py --> Creating weights and Building a sequence model

sample.py --> Sampling the trained model (with epochs, seed, len as arguments)

logs/training_log.csv --> Training loss/accuracy is stored in `logs/training_log.csv` with Epochs, Training Loss and Accuracy.

model --> saved models and weights

data --> Input data in abc-notation form and Char_to_index file

output --> Training Data log file with detailed info of Model Architecture and training loss, accuracy at every batch and epochs

Visualization --> A notebook with Visualizing Training loss and Accuracy over number of Epochs

## Usage

#### To train the model with default settings:

```
python train.py
```
It took 3 hours for me to run the model in my local system (CPU).

#### To sample the model with 100 epochs :

Here I did not gave argument for first character to start with, therefore the model pick a random character and generate output.

```
python sample.py 100
```

##### The output can be tested in the below website where we input the abc - notation of music generated by Char-RNN model.
